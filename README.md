* So, the first step is to use this <a href="https://github.com/SandeshReddyGS/Accenture-Data-Analytics-Visualization-Internship-/blob/main/Data%20model.pdf">data model</a> to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
* After Analysis we got data sets needed to complete analysis.
## Data Cleaning 
Clean the data by:
* removing rows that have values which are missing,changing the data type of some values within a column, and removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
* Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.
## End result will be three cleaned data set :
